Features
1. State management using GetX
2. Efficient routing
3. Handling real-time updates from Firestore.

1. GetX is used in this application to handle state management efficiently. 
The reason why I used GetX is:
- It allows for reactive programming, making it easy to react to changes in the state and update the UI accordingly
- It includes a robust routing system to manage navigation and routing within the application

How I've used GetX is Used in This Application
In this application, I've used it to manage the state of various UI components and handle user interactions. 
Controllers are created for different screens and components, and these controllers extend GetxController. The controllers are responsible for managing the state and business logic.
